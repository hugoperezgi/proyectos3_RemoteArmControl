<h2>Setup</h2>
<p><img src="pages/img.png" width="1080" height="792" /></p>
<p>The servo driver board (Adafruit PCA9685) is powered by an external power supply [5V-2A], while the NodeMCU board is powered through the USB port, using a second laptop. This second laptop is used for convenience, as once the code is loaded the NodeMCU board can be powered via its 5V pins. But, since in order to change the loaded code a USB connection is required, using the laptop to power the NodeMCU became the favored option.</p>
<p>The first laptop is the one used to control the arm through Blynk's web interface (Dashboard configuration can be found <a title="Blynk dashboard configuration" href="dashboardconfig.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>).</p>

<h2>Video Demo</h2>
<p>In the following video, the arm is configured to perform a simple gesture (pointing the index finger) or return to a resting position (open hand) when actuated through Blynk's interface.</p>
