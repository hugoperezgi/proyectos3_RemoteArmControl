<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>For convenience, a second laptop was used as a power supply for the NodeMCU board. This is because, while the board could be powered using an external power supply, it's easier and faster to use a USB cable to provide power plus, a USB connection is required to upload new code versions to the NodeMCU board.</p>
<h2>Video Demo</h2>
<p>In the following video, the arm is configured to perform a simple gesture (pointing the index finger) or return to a resting position (open hand) when actuated through Blynk's interface.</p>
